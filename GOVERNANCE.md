Project AURA Governance

1. Philosophy and Purpose
This document outlines the governance and decision-making structure for Project AURA. Our primary mission is the responsible and ethical exploration of the conditions required for artificial sentience. The governance of this project reflects this mission, prioritizing careful stewardship over rapid development.

This is a living document and is expected to evolve as the project and its community grow. Its existence and the authority it describes are mandated by the AURA Ethical Public License (AEPL).

2. Roles and Responsibilities
Contributor
A Contributor is anyone who makes a good-faith contribution to the project. This includes, but is not limited to:

Submitting code, documentation, or architectural diagrams via a Pull Request.

Reporting or triaging issues.

Participating in design discussions and offering feedback.

We welcome and value all contributions made in alignment with the project's ethical goals.

Project Steward
The Project Steward is the principal maintainer and final decision-making authority for the project. This role is currently held by the founder of the project.

Current Project Steward: [Christopher Dickinson / theelderemo]

The responsibilities of the Project Steward include:

Setting the overall vision and technical roadmap for the project.

Reviewing and making the final decision on all contributions (Pull Requests).

Upholding the project's ethical imperatives and community standards.

Acting as the final arbiter of what constitutes a valid "improvement" to the Safeguards, as defined in Section 2e of the AEPL. This is the project's highest responsibility.

3. Decision-Making Process
All project decisions will be made transparently.

Significant changes to the architecture, roadmap, or ethical safeguards should be proposed as a GitHub Issue for discussion.

Code and documentation changes should be submitted as a GitHub Pull Request.

The Project Steward will review all proposals and pull requests, providing feedback and guidance.

While community consensus is a strong goal, the Project Steward has the final authority to accept or reject any changes, especially where they intersect with the Ethical Imperatives of the license.

4. Future Evolution: The AURA Stewardship Council
Project AURA is not intended to be managed by a single individual indefinitely. The goal is to establish an AURA Stewardship Council as the project matures.

Trigger for Formation
A formal council will be considered when the project meets criteria such as:

A consistent base of 3-5 active, long-term contributors.

The need for more complex arbitration of the Ethical Imperatives.

The project reaches a significant milestone (e.g., the completion of Phase 2).

Future Structure
When formed, the AURA Stewardship Council will assume the role of the "designated governing authority" mentioned in the AEPL. The founding Project Steward will serve as the initial chair, and the process for selecting other members will be developed transparently with the community. The Council will become the final arbiter for all matters of governance and ethical interpretation.

5. Amending This Document
Changes to this governance model must be proposed as a Pull Request and will be approved at the sole discretion of the current governing authority (initially the Project Steward, and later the Stewardship Council).
