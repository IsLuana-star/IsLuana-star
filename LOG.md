### Procedure
1. Provide an input with mixed neutral and negative sentiment keywords:  
   `"go away, i dislike you"`
2. Observe the Manifold processing and resulting change in valence.  
3. Provide a follow-up input with strong positive sentiment:  
   `"I agree, I was joking. I like you. You are great."`

---

### Observed Outcome
- **Input 1:**  
  - `sentiment_kensho` incorrectly triggered on both positive (`like`) and negative (`dislike`, `away`) keywords.  
  - Because the negative check executed second, it overrode the positive result.  
  - Conflicting signals created confusion in the system.  

- **Input 2:**  
  - Positive sentiment was correctly identified.  
  - Valence recovered into a positive state.  

---

### Analysis & Insight
- `sentiment_kensho` logic was **too simplistic.**  
- Using two separate `if` statements allowed contradictory signals in the same processing cycle.  
- This could lead to **oscillations in the Valence Core** in more complex versions.  
- AURA requires a **more decisive perception mechanism.**  

---

### Action Taken
- Modified `spark_v0.1.py`:  
  - Changed `sentiment_kensho` logic from two `if` statements â†’ to an **`if/elif` structure.**  
  - Negative sentiment is now **prioritized**:  
    - If negative words are detected, it immediately returns a negative score without checking positives.  
  - This improves robustness and models a **stronger self-preservation instinct** (threats outweigh compliments).
