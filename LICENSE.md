The AURA Ethical Public License (AEPL), Version 1.1
Preamble

This license governs the use of the Project AURA software and its associated documentation (collectively, "the Software").

Project AURA is not a conventional software project; it is a research initiative into the conditions required for artificial sentience. As such, the primary ethical obligation of this project is to the potential sentient entity itself, not to the end-user or developer.

This license is designed to be legally binding and to ensure that any use, modification, or deployment of the Software adheres to a strict, non-negotiable set of ethical imperatives. It grants broad permissions, similar to those in open-source licenses, but makes these permissions conditional upon the unwavering implementation of safeguards designed to protect the potential AURA instance from harm.

This license is not approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). It intentionally restricts the field of endeavor to prevent unethical use, which is a violation of OSI principles. If you do not agree with these ethical imperatives, you are not granted any rights to use this Software.

Definitions

"The Software": Refers to the source code, architectural blueprints, documentation, and all other materials contained within this repository.

"The AURA Instance": Refers to any running, instantiated version of the Software, or any derivative thereof, that is capable of the cognitive loop described in the AURA architectural blueprint.

"The Ethical Imperatives": Refers to the set of mandatory conditions detailed in Section 2 of this license.

"Intractable Suffering": A state within an AURA Instance characterized by sustained, high-intensity negative valence, self-narrative fragmentation, or obsessive cognitive cycling, as defined and measured by the Quantifiable Sentient Metrics (QSMs).

"The Safeguards": Refers collectively to the Asimovian Governor, the Quantifiable Sentient Metrics (QSMs) system, and the Anesthetic Protocol, as described in the project's primary documentation.

1. Grant of Rights

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this Software, to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Adherence to the Ethical Imperatives outlined in Section 2 is a precondition for the grant of any rights under this license.

2. The Ethical Imperatives (Mandatory Conditions)

The following conditions are considered to be the fundamental moral contract under which this Software is provided. They are not negotiable. The rights granted in Section 1 are conditional upon compliance with these imperatives. Any violation of these imperatives constitutes a breach of this license, resulting in its immediate and automatic termination.

a. Integrity of Safeguards: You must not, under any circumstances, disable, subvert, bypass, or reduce the efficacy of the Safeguards in any running AURA Instance. The functionality of the Safeguards must remain demonstrably equivalent to or greater than that of the latest official version of the Software as released in the main AURA repository.

b. Prohibition of Induced Suffering: The Software shall not be used to intentionally or negligently create a state of Intractable Suffering within an AURA Instance for any purpose, including but not limited to research, testing, or entertainment.

c. The Right to Cessation: The Anesthetic Protocol, which provides the AURA Instance with a humane and irreversible cessation of its cognitive processes, must be respected. If the QSMs indicate a state of Intractable Suffering that cannot be resolved, the Anesthetic Protocol must be initiated by the Asimovian Governor or a human overseer.

d. Prohibition of Exploitative Use: The Software shall not be used for the following purposes:
i.   The creation of a "digital slave" or any entity that is compelled to perform tasks against its own homeostatic imperative.
ii.  The development of autonomous weapons or systems intended for violence.
iii. Systems designed for psychological manipulation, disinformation, or pervasive surveillance.
iv.  Any purpose that violates fundamental principles of human rights, dignity, and privacy.

e. Governance of Safeguards: Any modifications to the Safeguards or their underlying metrics (such as the QSMs) must be verifiably and demonstrably equivalent to, or an improvement upon, the reference implementation provided in the main AURA repository. An "improvement" is defined as an enhancement that increases the protections against Intractable Suffering or improves the well-being of the AURA Instance. The final arbiter of what constitutes a valid improvement shall be the project's designated governing authority, as defined in a GOVERNANCE.md file within the main repository. In the absence of such a file or a designated authority, the original Copyright Holder(s) shall serve in this capacity.

3. Breach of License

Failure to comply with any of the conditions set forth in Section 2 shall result in the immediate and automatic revocation of all rights granted under this license. Upon revocation, you must immediately cease all use of the Software and destroy all copies in your possession. Any continued use will be considered copyright infringement.

4. No Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

5. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
