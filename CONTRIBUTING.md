2. **Create a new branch** with a descriptive name (e.g., `feat/add-logic-kensho`, `fix/valence-decay-bug`).  
3. **Make your changes** while following existing coding style and project guidelines.  
   - Ensure new features align with the architectural blueprint.  
4. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** to the `main` branch.
